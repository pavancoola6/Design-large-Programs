 PROJECT OVERVIEW!

 This project is all about creating domino game console and console to GUI . We had to create two versions where one version uses only standard input from user without graphics ir any interface precisely. The second version is graphics where you get to see the graphical interface of domino game and used git and intellij as my editor. 

 BUGS!

 The played dominoes are not displayed on the boneyard. It displayed the rows (heads) only.
 My game is not the exact match of how the instructor provided , but tried to match as much as i can and tried something new and has a poor interface.
