# Lab Overview 
This project is all about creating a mathematical visualization in Java FX through GUI and i learnt a lot basics of how to write java FX code . And used git and intellij as my editor. 

# Brief about project!

  As the interface is shown you will see a circle and the parameters to your left . At first You will see a "time table number" label and the parameters where how much the timetable is incremented by . Also by "delay by " which relies on speed of the visualization. After moving to the parameters section, we can see that there are two user inputs. One user input allows the user to enter their favorite timetable and the other input is number of points you want on circle. Also we have few buttons inorder to make these inputs work.Run and pause buttons inorder to start and stop the visualization. Also i created a choicebox of my favorite visualizations .
